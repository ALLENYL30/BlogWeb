# About Me

My name is Allen Liu. I'm an experienced software developer with 2 years of experience in
the industry.

I have a strong background in full-stack development, combining expertise in C#, .NET, and React with a deep
understanding of software architecture and design patterns. My technical toolkit spans both back-end technologies (SQL
Server, PowerShell, Docker, Azure) and front-end frameworks (React, Redux, TypeScript), allowing me to build
comprehensive web solutions from database to user interface. I pride myself on writing clean, maintainable code and
implementing efficient CI/CD pipelines. Passionate about creating high-quality software that solves real-world problems,
I continuously explore new technologies and best practices to deliver exceptional results while maintaining a
collaborative approach to development.

## Professional Craft

I architect and deliver enterprise-grade solutions using:

- **ASP.NET Core** (full-stack web development)
- **React.js** (modern front-end component architecture)
- **Docker & Kubernetes** (containerization and orchestration)
- **Azure Cloud Services** (serverless, PaaS, and IaaS implementations)
- **SQL Server** (performance tuning & complex query optimization)
- **Entity Framework Core** (data modeling and advanced ORM patterns)

## Learning Journey

Starting with C# console apps, my skillset quickly expanded to include:

- Modern web development with **ASP.NET Core MVC/Web API**
- Single-page applications using **React, Redux, and TypeScript**
- RESTful API design using **Restful APIs** and **Swagger/OpenAPI**
- End-to-end DevOps with **Git**, **Azure DevOps**, and **CI/CD pipelines**
- Cloud-native architecture patterns on **Azure/AWS**

I'm currently diving into the deep end:

- Microservices architecture with **service mesh** patterns and **DDD principles**
- Full-stack .NET/React applications with optimized performance
- Event-driven architectures using **Azure Service Bus**
- Advanced **Kubernetes** operators and custom resources

## Community & Innovation

I thrive on collaborative growth:

- Open-source contributor (GitHub repositories focused on .NET utilities)
- Tech blogger documenting architecture patterns and Azure hacks
- Regular attendee at .NET Conf and Azure Meetups
- Workshop facilitator for Blazor hands-on labs

## Aspirations

- Becoming a .NET Solutions Architect specializing in cloud-native systems
- Mastering distributed systems design and enterprise-scale patterns
- Bridging the gap between AI innovation and traditional software engineering
- Elevating developers through open-source mentorship and technical advocacy
