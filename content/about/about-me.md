# About Me

Hi, I'm Yuhao!

I'm a Junior C# Developer who started my professional journey in software development two years ago. My passion for coding began during my computer science studies, where I fell in love with the .NET ecosystem and its capabilities.

## Professional Experience

Currently, I work at TechFlow Solutions as a Junior Software Developer, where I get to work with:

- ASP.NET Core web applications
- Azure cloud services
- SQL Server databases
- Entity Framework Core
- Blazor WebAssembly

I've been fortunate to be part of a team that develops and maintains enterprise applications, giving me hands-on experience with real-world software development challenges. My daily work involves writing clean code, implementing new features, and learning from senior developers who mentor me.

## Learning Journey

My tech journey started with console applications in C#, but I quickly expanded into:

- Web development using ASP.NET Core
- Building RESTful APIs
- Working with Git and Azure DevOps
- Understanding CI/CD pipelines
- Learning cloud architecture on Azure

I'm currently diving deeper into:

- Microservices architecture
- Docker containerization
- Advanced Entity Framework concepts
- Azure Functions and serverless computing
- Clean Architecture principles

## Community Involvement

I believe in growing together with the developer community. You can find me:

- Contributing to small open-source projects on GitHub
- Attending local .NET meetups
- Writing technical articles on my blog
- Participating in coding workshops

## Side Projects

I maintain a few personal projects to experiment with new technologies:

- A task management application built with Blazor
- A weather notification service using Azure Functions
- Various GitHub repositories where I practice new concepts

## Goals

As a junior developer, I'm focused on:

- Strengthening my foundation in C# and .NET
- Learning cloud-native development practices
- Understanding enterprise software architecture
- Contributing more to open-source projects
- Eventually becoming a full-stack .NET developer
